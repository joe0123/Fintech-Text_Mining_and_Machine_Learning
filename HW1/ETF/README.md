# ETF crawler
In this project, we download all daily adjusted close of ETFs in 'Junk-ETF-list.csv' from the last trading day in 2015 untill now.
Because there is no any clue found in their homepages, we crawl Yahho Finance to accomplish our mission.


## Crawler Package
We implement **Selenium** as our crawler.
In collaboration with _driver_, though time-consuming, it's rather more straightforward for general users.
